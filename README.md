# tl-terminal
The simplest translator you can use on your computer

## How to use
Install the python file, make sure you have python in the latest version along with pip and venv. Using 'venv' you create an environment with it, and then install 'pyinstaller' and 'translate' through pip and after that use the command "pyinstaller --onefile tl.py", the file name is suggestive and is at your discretion. After that, move it to the folder where the binaries on your computer are and give it permission to run. There, you have your own translator in the terminal.
